This application was completed throughout the Object Oriented Programming in Java Coursera class (https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-java), one of the classes in the Object Oriented Java Programming: Data Structures and Beyond specialization offered by the University of California, San Diego

The project for this course is to build an application that displays the most recent earthquakes on a world map. The earthquakes are classified as land quakes or ocean quakes. Clicking on an earthquake provides additional information about the earthquake.

I have attempted to clearly distinguish between the code I authored and the code authored by UCSD.

For this project, I worked with Unfolding Maps Java package to build an interactive GUI that displays a world map with earthquakes, designed classes used by the applet to display earthquake information read by USGS RSS feed. For the project extension, I wrote class methods to facilitate display of extra earthquake information via a pop-up menu.

A majority of the code I wrote can be found in the following folders:

src/module1/

src/module3/

src/module4/

src/module5/

src/module6/

Note: All of the TODOs in the file were written by me throughout the course.
